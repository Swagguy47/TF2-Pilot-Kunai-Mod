Restores some cut features of the unused Pilot Kunai melee in Titanfall 2.
This is a part of my bigger upcoming cut content restoration mod, but for now you can download it seperately and play around with early.
_______________________________________________________
NOTE:
THIS MOD WILL BECOME OUTDATED WHEN THE CUT CONTENT RESTORATION MOD RELEASES
If you decide to use the Cut Content Restoration mod disable this from your modlist as it will just be included already.

This mod does not add anything new to the Icepick menu, you must give yourself the weapons and mods via the console. (~ key) (sv_cheats 1)

Useful commands:

Pilot Kunai:
`give melee_pilot_arena pilot_kunai`
